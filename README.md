# foamPy

A work-in-progress Python package for working with OpenFOAM--not to be confused
with PyFoam. Basically, this is a collection of useful functions and scripts
I have written and want to have available for the sake of reproducibility. 

## Installation

In this directory, run

    python setup.py install
